## Presentation

SEAHORS is a R Shiny free open-source application, that allows easy and
quick exploration of the spatial distribution of archaeological objects.
The main goal of this application is to make the two and
three-dimensional spatial exploration of archaeological data as
user-friendly as possible, in order to give opportunities to researchers
not familiar with GIS and R to undertake such approaches.

SEAHORS has an easily accessible interface and uses text and Excel files
(.csv and .xls respectively). The application includes functions to
merge several databases, for example when spatial data and analysis data
are stored in separate files.

SEAHORS can generate five types of plots: 3D, 2D and density plots, as
well as plots for which it is possible to cut off the site into slices
and to modify the angle of projection to explore spatial organisation
without constraint of the grid orientation. SEAHORS has visualization
tools with several sorting and formatting keys (colours) applicable to
coordinates and all possible analysis variables (i.e. levels, splits,
analytical attributes).

## Installation

* Install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and optionally [Rstudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop) to have a more comfortable R environment.
* Install SEAHORS from github:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AurelienRoyer/SEAHORS")
```

Load the package and launch the SEAHORS app:

```r
library(SEAHORS)
SEAHORS()
```

## Demonstration and tutorial

The application overview is detailled the paper (Royer et al. preprint,
see Reference).

A tutorial video of SEAHORS is available [in English](https://nakala.fr/10.34847/nkl.3fdd6h8j) and [in French](https://nakala.fr/10.34847/nkl.65bf1h72).

A web application of SEAHORS is deployed on a [Shinyapps.io server](https://aurelienroyer.shinyapps.io/Seahors).
